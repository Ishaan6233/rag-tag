# rag-tag

A research-oriented toolkit for **IFC-based digital twins** that combines **geometry-aware graph construction** with **LLM-driven graph reasoning**. The project turns BIM data into a structured knowledge graph and enables natural-language querying via a controlled, multi-step agent (Graph RAG).

---

## What this project is about

Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models contain rich information about buildings — geometry, hierarchy, types, and properties — but they are difficult to query without BIM expertise or specialized tools.

**rag-tag** bridges that gap by:

1. Converting IFC models into a **typed, hierarchical knowledge graph** enriched with real geometry
2. Exposing that graph through a **safe query interface**
3. Using an **LLM as a planning agent** that reasons over the graph via tool calls (Graph RAG)

The result is a foundation for **LLM-assisted digital twins** that can answer spatial, semantic, and structural questions about buildings.

## Key Features

* **IFC → CSV**
  Extract structured IFC element data into tabular form for inspection and downstream processing.

* **IFC → Geometry-Enriched Graph**
  Build a directed, hierarchical graph of IFC entities with centroids and spatial relationships.

* **Spatial Reasoning**
  Automatically infer `adjacent_to` relationships between elements based on 3D proximity.

* **Interactive 3D Visualization**
  Explore the IFC graph in a Plotly-based 3D viewer (HTML output).

* **Graph RAG Agent**
  Query the IFC graph using natural language via an LLM that plans multi-step graph queries instead of hallucinating answers.

## Requirements

### Core dependencies

* Python 3.10+
* `ifcopenshell`
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `networkx`
* `plotly`
* `cohere`

### Dev / tooling

* `ruff`
* `pre-commit`
* `uv`

---

## Formatting & Linting (Ruff)

This repository uses **Ruff** for formatting and linting.

### One-time setup

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Manual checks

```bash
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check --fix .
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

---

## IFC → CSV

The script `parser/ifc_to_csv.py` extracts structured element data from IFC files.

### Default behavior

* **Input**: Auto-detects an `IFC-Files/` directory by searching upward
* **Output**: Writes CSV files to `output/` at the project root
* **Schema**: GlobalId, IFC class, level/storey, type, name, and selected properties

Run:

```bash
cd parser
uv run ifc_to_csv.py
```

Override paths:

```bash
uv run ifc_to_csv.py --ifc-dir ./IFC-Files --out-dir ./output
```

---

## IFC → Graph (3D)

The graph pipeline converts IFC data into a **directed knowledge graph** enriched with geometry and spatial adjacency.

### Graph model

**Nodes**

* `IfcProject`
* `IfcBuilding`
* `IfcBuildingStorey`
* `IfcTypeObject`
* Individual IFC elements (`IfcWall`, `IfcDoor`, `IfcSlab`, ...)

**Edges**

* `aggregates` – project/building/storey hierarchy
* `contained_in` – storey → element
* `typed_by` – type → element
* `adjacent_to` – spatial proximity (distance-based)

**Node attributes**

* `label` – human-readable name
* `class_` – IFC class
* `properties` – full CSV row as a dictionary
* `geometry` – centroid or bounding box

---

### Geometry handling

Geometry is extracted using `ifcopenshell.geom`:

* **Centroid**: Mean of mesh vertices (used for node placement)
* **Bounding box**: Axis-aligned extents (optional)

If geometry is unavailable, nodes are positioned using the centroid of their children to avoid overlap.

---

### Run the graph pipeline

```bash
cd parser
uv run csv_to_graph.py
```

### Output

* `output/ifc_graph.html`

  * Interactive 3D Plotly visualization
  * Hover to inspect IFC properties
  * Color-coded by IFC class

---

## LLM-Assisted Graph Querying (Graph RAG)

The project includes an **LLM-driven planning agent** that answers natural-language questions by reasoning over the IFC graph.

### Architecture overview

* **LLM (Cohere Command R+)**: Acts as a planner
* **Graph tools**: Controlled Python functions (`ifc_graph_tool.py`)
* **Executor loop**: Runs multi-step ReAct-style reasoning (`run_agent.py`)

The LLM:

* does *not* see the graph directly
* must request graph operations via JSON tool calls
* can chain multiple steps before producing a final answer

---

### Example questions

* "What elements are on Level 2?"
* "Which walls are adjacent to this door?"
* "Find doors near the stair core"
* "What elements are close to this column within 2 meters?"

---

### Run the agent

Set your API key:

```bash
COHERE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Then start the interactive agent:

```bash
uv run run_agent.py
```

The agent will:

1. Interpret the question
2. Plan one graph query at a time
3. Accumulate results in memory
4. Produce a final, grounded answer

---

## IFC Viewer + Chat Web App (IFC.js)

This adds a web UI with:

* **IFC.js viewer** (That Open Components)
* **Chat panel** backed by the existing graph agent

### Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
uv sync
uv run uvicorn server.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend (Vite)

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and you should see:

* The IFC model rendered in 3D
* A chat panel at the bottom for graph queries

### Production build (optional)

```bash
cd web
npm run build
```

Then serve the built UI from FastAPI:

```bash
uv run uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Notes

* The server reads IFC files from `IFC-Files/`
* The graph uses the matching CSV in `output/<ifc>.csv`
* Generate CSVs with: `uv run python parser/ifc_to_csv.py`
* Set `COHERE_API_KEY` in `.env` for chat responses

---

## One-Command Dev (Backend + Frontend)

Run both the FastAPI server and Vite dev server together:

```bash
uv run python scripts/dev.py
```

## Console IFC Hierarchy Inspection (Optional)

A helper function prints the raw IFC hierarchy directly from the file:

```python
print_ifc_hierarchy(ifc_file)
```

Output structure:

```
IfcProject
 └── IfcBuilding
     └── IfcBuildingStorey
         └── IfcElement
```
